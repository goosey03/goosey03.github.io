  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)
  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)
  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

JAMES GOUSIAS COMMENTS

- With my style ive altered to go for a simplistic green palette themed link which fits nicely with the green background. 
Ive also added a different pointer when clicking on the link to show that the progress of the link is loading. 

The load throbber has been altered to fit the green style palette with a ease infinite circle which spins at 1.5s which i found not 
too fast but not too slow also gives the visual impression that the website is loading faster.

ive changed to button to the 2 tone colours which has a transition when clicked on it making it highlighted when hovered over
the mouse key also shows a progress when hovered. 

ive opted for a circle spinner to show the transition between pages which it fits simplistically
and shows how the transition clear and as described.

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

        The function loadPageAfterDelay() is declared in the file fakeLoad.js - it takes a number value that sets the 
        amount of time it takes in ms and a url to redirect to.

        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.

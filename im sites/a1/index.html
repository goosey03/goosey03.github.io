        <h2> Question's from Week 2</h2>

                <p> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>
                    <p>The first thing I paid attention to was how the mouse interaction affected the image in a distorted and manipulative way. I also noticed the side menu bar which had the controls and allowed the manipulation to be altered in various ways. The different motions and light particles which faded in and out of the experience also caught my attention. </p>
                <p> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</p>
                    <ol start="1">
                    <li>Loading into the website and seeing a blank image of a warehouse and beginning to wonder what the experience is all about.</li>
                    <li>Moving my mouse over the image to reveal the distortion and entropy which moved across my whole screen. Swirling around my mouse the screen and creating a vary distorted image.</li>
                    <li>Looking at the control menu on the side and changing the different controls. Playing around with the mouse size and speed and experimenting with the effects of altering these controls.</li>
                    <li>Playing with the mouse and swirling around.</li>
                    </ol>
                <p> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </p>
                    <p>I spent the most part playing with the controls on the side bar menu and experimenting with the different patterns that were created when playing with the mouse. I also enjoyed just playing around with the mouse and seeing how much distortion I could make. </p>
                <p> 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
                    <p>Swaying the mouse around the screen and creating various patterns in the experience. Also using the controls on the side bar to change the distortion and experimenting with this. Even looking at the patterns and distortion on the screen was visually interesting. </p>
                <p> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>
                    <p>The primary goal of Liquid Entropy is to provide a visual website experience which can be altered by the user to create their own experience with the help of the controls. The experience also may be intended to create an alternative view of the original artwork of the warehouse image.</p>
                <p> 6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</p>
                    <p>My impression of Liquid Entropy is to provide an experience which shows how the user can alter the image and distortion by playing around with the controls. The feel of the experience is almost psychedelic and very confusing at times. The light effects create a metallic feel to the experience and the screen feels like it is melting. This ties in with the industrial image in which the experience is encapsulated in. </p>
                <p> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p>
                    <p>Over time the Liquid Entropy experience doesnt vary much because it is a set experience with only so many options to do, options being altering with the controls and interacting with the experience or just watching the screen as the distortion continues. The experience should be interacted with depending on what the user wants this being if the user wants a heavily distorted experience they can alter the speed and leave the distortion recurring endlessly vice versa. </p>
                <p> 8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</p>
                    <p>Over time the experience did not communicate any way of specifically interacting with it but more so the users curiosity over time made the changes which were accessible via the controls or just using the mouse to make the distortions and visually change the experience. </p>
                <p> 9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</p>
                    <p>Liquid Entropy expresses media forms such as videos from youtube more so the melting of metals in a crucible which reminded me of the visual effect in Liquid Entropy and how they screen flowed like liquid metal. Liquid Entropy also referenced and had similar visual effects to the 2011 video game Portal 2 which featured the ability to teleport and solve puzzles. The liquid effect in the experience reminded me of the portal's texture and the matterless boundary. </p>
                <p> 10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it? </p>
                    <p>The Liquid Entropy experience suggests experimentation with the endless possibilities it can be changed. The controls sidebar menu has various options to change the effect; these include refraction/reverb, mouse size, speed, zoom, lookupradius, normalsradius, lightness, gleams, entropy and worm. These all individually influence the effect overall allowing the viewer to change the experience to their liking. </p>
                <p> 11.What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</p>
                    <p>The Liquid Entropy experience creates a ‘trippy’ effect put into my own words. I associated it with psychedelic art and the liquid flow of metal. When engaging with the experience I enjoyed having the freedom of doing whatever felt enjoyable. The experience allows you to change how you feel when interacting with it as the settings can create sophisticated distortions which puzzle you and almost make the experiences confusing and overwhelming. </p>
                <p> 12.What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</p>
                    <p>The most frustrating element of Liquid Entropy is the control dynamics and how they function. The controls are highly sensitive and effect the experience majorly. Altering one of the controls significantly makes the experience very difficult to understand and you would have to restart the experience. </p>
                <p> 13.What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</p>
                    <p>The most satisfying element of Liquid Entropy is the smoothness of the mouse interaction and the metallic effect of the distortion. The light and particle effects are also very satisfying and tie in nicely with the metallic gleam of the distortion. </p>
